- As a guest (or any user), I want to:
	- view the calendar of events and select an event
	- select a table/vendor at an event, and see the shoes they're selling
	- sign in, if I already have one
	- register as a new user
- As a user, I want to:
	- search for a shoe from an external API
	- add a shoe (searched or at a table) to my "favorites"
	- view my favorite shoes and remove one
	- select a vendor and "follow" them
	- view my followed vendors and unfollow one
	- apply to become a vendor
	- see my notifications
- As a vendor, I want to:
	(everything a user can do)
	- book a table within an event
	- add shoes (with price and quality) to my table
	- cancel a table
- As an admin, I want to:
	(everything a user can do)
	- create an event
	- cancel an event
	- approve/deny a user to become an vendor
