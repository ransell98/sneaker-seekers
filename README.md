    Anyone who uses Sneaker Seekers while being logged into an account. Users can do everything a guest can do, as well as

    All vendors and admins are users, but not all users are vendors and admins.
*Vendor*
    A user who has been approved by an admin to become a vendor. Vendors can claim one table per event on a first-come-

    if they wish to do so.

    upcoming events.  
*Event*

    attend events, but only vendors with tables may sell shoes at their table. Different events have a different number of
