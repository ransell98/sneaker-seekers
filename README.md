# Sneaker Seekers
## Problem Statement
The world of sneakers expands across multiple communities due to its diversity in individuals! It provides a common ground for sneaker-heads to connect with one another on their love for rare, unique, and limited edition sneakers. Another common practice in the world of sneakers is the practice of selling, trading, and flipping sneakers with other sneaker-heads. Sneaker Seekers is a sneaker convention that will allow sneaker-heads to connect face-to-face, whether it is to share their love or to sell and flip sneakers. Through the Sneaker Seekers website, vendors, customers, and guests will be able to explore upcoming Sneaker Seekers convention events, whether it is to book a table as a vendor, explore the different vendors and sneakers available at the event, or to simply attend the convention event. 
It may be difficult for customers and even vendors to bridge the gap in connecting with others. Sneaker Seekers will provide a common ground for customers and sellers. Customers will have the ability to come onto the Sneaker Seekers website to explore the different vendors and the shoes available through various vendors. Additionally, customers will have the power at the tip of their fingers to pre-shop for their favorite shoes at upcoming Sneaker Seekers conventions by simpling going on the website. Vendors will have the opportunity to expand their platform and promote the shoes they are selling by connecting with customers and other vendors. Overall, sharing the love of sneakers and developing/expanding one's platform has never been easier!
